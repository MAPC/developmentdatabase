# Development Database Search

## Overview

This is the main repository for one of the Development Database's key features: development search. This feature is built with ember-cli and is structured as an embeddable app, meaning it will bind to a given element nested inside a larger Ruby on Rails structure.

## Development

Run `ember install` then `ember serve`. The project is set up with a mock API server at localhost:4200/api. To compile the final product, run `ember build`. This builds a JavaScript file inside the /dist folder.
